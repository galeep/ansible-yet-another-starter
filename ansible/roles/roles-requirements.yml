# This file is part of a mechanism for creating a local cache of 
# external roles. These can be examined prior to execution, run 
# against airgapped environments, etc. [12/2021: this can be used
# with ansible-galaxy :)
#
# It feels woefully hacky outside of the specialty context that 
# required it. This is part of why Ansible is so loose about 
# prescriptions. I am leaving it here as a curiosity.
#
# Maybe there's a better mechanism for this now -- gep 12/2020
# ##
# 12/2021: yes, there is! Sort of. ansible-galaxy was not
# available to me when this was initially put together, but this
# file can be used as an ansible-galaxy requirements.yml! Just
# make sure ansible-galaxy uses the 'external' directory for
# roles. This also pre-dates collections, fancy versioning, etc.
# If you use this, use ansible-galaxy to handle role management
# within the 'external' directory.
#
# Guess it wasn't as hacky as I thought :-)
# ##
#
# Add external roles (and optionally pin their versions) here.
#
# Example: 
#
# - src: git+https://github.com/azavea/ansible-pip.git
#   name: azavea.pip
#   version: 'v1.1.0'
# 
# - src: (...)
